📖  I'm a <b>final year PhD student</b> in Prof. Jane Farrar's laboratory in the Smurfit Institute of Genetics at <b>Trinity College Dublin.</b>

👁  My <b>research focuses on diseases that affect the retina</b>, a layer of cells at the back of your eye that allows you to see!

🧬  I use various <b>DNA sequencing</b> techniques to look at <b>patient DNA</b> and discover the <b>genetic cause</b> of these diseases. 

📸  I <b>document</b> a lot of <b>life as a PhD student on Instagram and Twitter (@PhDWithLaura)</b>.

📺  <b>Outside of my work and online life</b>, I spend <i>far too much</i> time at the <b>cinema</b>, watching a multitude of <b>series</b> and <b>reading</b>!
